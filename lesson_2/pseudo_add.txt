#1 a method that returns the sum of two integers

START

PRINT add_number

#2 a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

START

# given a array of strings called "array_one"

SET iterator = 1
SET new_string = ''

WHILE iterator <= length of array_one
    append string to new_string
    iterator = iterator + 1

#3 a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

START 

# given an array of integers called "array_one"

SET iterator = 1
SET new_array = []

WHILE iterator <= length of array_one
  IF array position is not odd add to new_array
